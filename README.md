# 🔧 Agentic AI for Infrastructure Operations

A fully autonomous **Agentic AI platform** built with **FastAPI** and **LangChain** to intelligently manage and resolve infrastructure incidents with minimal human intervention. This system leverages natural language interfaces, real-time context integration, and operational tooling to drastically reduce MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) and manual workloads.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🤖 **Autonomous Incident Handling**  
  Reduces MTTR by up to **75%** through intelligent triaging, remediation, and reporting.

- 💬 **Natural Language Execution**  
  Operators can describe tasks like:
  - “Provision a new Ubuntu server”
  - “Patch all critical security updates”
  - “Add a new user to the staging environment”

  ...and the AI agent will **execute** them end-to-end.

- 🌐 **Real-Time Context Awareness**  
  - Integrates with **web search** and **CMDBs** to gather live environment data.
  - Improves **incident root cause accuracy by 80%**.

- 🧠 **LangChain Agent Architecture**  
  Custom AI agents designed for infrastructure tasks with built-in memory, tools, and dynamic context-switching.

- ⚙️ **FastAPI Backend**  
  - RESTful interface for chat, command execution, and results tracking.
  - Easily extensible for Slack, CLI, or web dashboards.
