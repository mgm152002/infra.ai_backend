Incident: Docker daemon not responding on EC2 instance i-09db36f1e0414f2db causing service outage - Incident INC2025001297: Docker daemon not responding on EC2 instance i-09db36f1e0414f2db causing service outage
System: AmazonLinux at 43.204.101.3


Known runbook / SOP context from the internal knowledge base:
e Docker 
 sudo systemctl start docker 
 sudo systemctl enable docker 
 5. Post-Installation Validation 
 Step 1: Verify Docker service 
 sudo systemctl status docker 
 Expected:  active (running) 
 Step 2: Check Docker version 
 docker --version 
 Example output: 
 Docker version 25.x.x, build xxxxx 
 Step 3: Run Docker test container 
 sudo docker run hello-world 
 Expected Output 
 ●  Docker pulls the  hello-world  image 
 ●  Prints a message confirming Docker is installed and running correctly 
 Step 4: Verify running containers 
 docker ps -a 
 Expected:  hello-world  container listed with status  Exited (0) 
 6. Validation Checklist 
 Check  Expected Result 
 Docker installed  docker --version  works 
 Docker service  Active and running 
 Test container  hello-world  runs successfully 
 User access  Docker works without sudo (if configured) 
 7. Common Troubleshooting 
 Docker permission denied 
 permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon 
 socket 
 Fix: 
 sud

y 
 User access  Docker works without sudo (if configured) 
 7. Common Troubleshooting 
 Docker permission denied 
 permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon 
 socket 
 Fix: 
 sudo usermod -aG docker <username> 
 logout 
 Docker service not running 
 sudo systemctl restart docker 
 8. Security & Best Practices 
 ●  Avoid running Docker as root in production 
 ●  Keep Docker updated regularly 
 ●  Use trusted images only (Docker Hub official images) 
 ●  Enable logging and monitoring if running long-lived containers 
 9. References 
 ●  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

System: AmazonLinux at 43.204.101.3


Known runbook / SOP context from the internal knowledge base:
e Docker 
 sudo systemctl start docker 
 sudo systemctl enable docker 
 5. Post-Installation Validation 
 Step 1: Verify Docker service 
 sudo systemctl status docker 
 Expected:  active (running) 
 Step 2: Check Docker version 
 docker --version 
 Example output: 
 Docker version 25.x.x, build xxxxx 
 Step 3: Run Docker test container 
 sudo docker run hello-world 
 Expected Output 
 ●  Docker pulls the  hello-world  image 
 ●  Prints a message confirming Docker is installed and running correctly 
 Step 4: Verify running containers 
 docker ps -a 
 Expected:  hello-world  container listed with status  Exited (0) 
 6. Validation Checklist 
 Check  Expected Result 
 Docker installed  docker --version  works 
 Docker service  Active and running 
 Test container  hello-world  runs successfully 
 User access  Docker works without sudo (if configured) 
 7. Common Troubleshooting 
 Docker permission denied 
 permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

# Docker Service Restart Procedure

## Incident Date
$(date -Iseconds)

## Maintenance Window Guidelines
1. Schedule restarts during low-traffic periods (typically 2-4 AM)
2. Notify team members 24 hours in advance
3. Verify all containers are backed up before restart

## Pre-Restart Checklist
- [ ] Check running containers: docker ps
- [ ] Save container states if needed
- [ ] Backup important data volumes
- [ ] Notify monitoring team

## Restart Commands
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker

## Post-Restart Verification
- Verify all expected containers are running
- Check application accessibility
- Review docker logs for errors

## Rollback Plan
- Keep previous Docker daemon configuration
- Document container states before restart
